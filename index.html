      <p> 
        Hi! My name is Evan Nadelbach and I am a senior at the University of Maryland, College Park.
        I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Statistics. This past summer, I was a
        software engineering intern at GEICO and am currently a TA for a lower-level computer science
        class (CMSC132).
      </p>

      <p>
        I have been interested in programming and computer science since I was in high school. I have
        an aptitude for learning and enjoy helping people whenever I can. In the future, I would like
        to showcase my skills in software engineering and join a team of people who share a similar
        passion.
      </p>

      <p>
        I like watching movies and playing video games, and riding my bicycle when the weather is nice.
        I like going to the gym and I am a fan of sci-fi movies. Whenever I have free time, I enjoy
        hanging out with friends.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h2 class="section-header">Personal Projects</h2>

      <p>
        I have worked on many personal projects over the past few years to showcase my programming knowledge
        over the years. All of them can be viewed on my GitHub page linked below. The most recent project I
        have completed is a program that allows you to rank a list of your choosing from best to worst. It
        asks the minimum number of questions necessary in order to get an exact list, and the number of
        remaining questions can also be viewed while running the program.
      </p>
